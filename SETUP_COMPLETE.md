## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Make your first commit

git commit -m "feat: initial project setup with standard-version"
```

### 2. Create your first release
```bash
npm run release -- --first-release
```

### 3. Push to remote
```bash
git push --follow-tags origin main
```

## 📝 Example Workflow

```bash
# Make changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional format (will be validated)
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user login functionality"

# More commits...
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"

# Create a release (will analyze commits and bump version)
npm run release:minor

# Push everything including tags
git push --follow-tags origin main
```

## 🎉 What Happens on Release?

1. Analyzes all commits since last release
2. Determines version bump based on commit types
3. Updates `package.json` version
4. Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md` with icons
5. Creates a git tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
6. Commits with message: `chore(release): v1.1.0 🚀`

## 📚 Next Steps

1. Read `README.md` for detailed usage instructions
2. Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
3. Start making commits following the conventional format
4. Run your first release when ready!

**Note**: The commit message hook will prevent commits that don't follow the conventional format. This ensures your changelog stays clean and releases are properly versioned.
